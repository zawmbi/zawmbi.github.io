# lindascomputing.xyz

This repository hosts my personal portfolio website, designed and developed from scratch using React.js and custom CSS. The site serves as a centralized space to share my work in data science, bioinformatics, and computational biology.

## Overview

The portfolio includes the following pages:

- **Projects** – A collection of coding, data, and applied research projects
- **Research** – Summaries of academic contributions, including posters and publications
- **Rosalind** – A personal log of solved bioinformatics problems from the Rosalind platform
- **About** – Background, current work, and professional interests
- **Contact** – A direct way to reach out

## Notes

This project was entirely self-built without templates or libraries beyond React. It is not intended for cloning or reuse. The codebase is shared here for transparency and version control purposes only.

If you're interested in collaborating or have questions about the design or content, feel free to reach out through the contact form on my site!
