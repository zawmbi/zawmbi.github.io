    <p> Hi, my name is Linda!<p>

    </p> I am a full-time student at the University of Illinois at Chicago studying Data 
    Science with a concentration in Bioinformatics. In addition to my course work, I work 
    part-time as an undergraduate research assistant of a computational biology lab focused 
    on plant transcriptomics. I recently presented my first poster on gene expression patterns 
    in silica dried plants at the Botany 2024 conference this past June! On the side, 
    I am in the early stages of a megaproject and collaborating with a large group of 
    talented peers involving pyrogenic organic matter. I aim to pursue graduate studies 
    in computational biology while gaining industry experience along the way. <p>
