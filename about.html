    <p> Hi, my name is Linda!<p>

    </p> I am a student at the University of Illinois at Chicago studying 
    Data Science with a concentration in Bioinformatics. My introduction to coding 
    was met with an eternally warm welcome, and tons of support from
    my peers and the teaching staff of the computer science courses.
    This given me the opportunity to thrive in this field! Apart from my 
    courses, I am an undergraduate research assistant of a computational 
    biology lab that studies plants. I am expecting to present my first ever 
    scientific poster at Botany 2024 in Grand Rapids, Michigan! On the side, 
    I am working on the early stages of a megaproject with a large group of 
    talented peers involving pyrogenic organic matter!<p>

    </p>Enjoy your stay :]</p>
