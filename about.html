    <p> Hi, my name is Linda!<p>

   
    <p style="font-size:18px; "> I am a full-time student at the University of Illinois at Chicago studying Data 
    Science with a concentration in Bioinformatics. In addition to my course work, I work 
    part-time as an undergraduate research assistant of a computational biology lab focused 
    on plant transcriptomics. I recently presented my first poster on gene expression patterns 
    in silica dried plants at the Botany 2024 conference this past June! On the side, 
    I am in the early stages of a megaproject and collaborating with a large group of 
    talented peers involving pyrogenic organic matter. I aim to pursue graduate studies 
    in computational biology while gaining industry experience along the way. <p>

    <p style="font-size:18px; "> I've always been an active person, but for the past three years, I have been 
    participating mostly in weightlifting! I enjoy jump-roping as well. Outside of the
    gym, I love exploring the nature walks that Illinois has to offer, particularly in the 
    Palos Forest Preserves. When I have lots of time, I enjoy ice skating indoors and outdoors! <p>
    
    </p> 

    <p style="font-size:18px; "> At home, I have three cats and a garden. I grow fruits, veggies, herbs,
    and flowers. Some of my more successful plants are tomatoes, cantaloupes, garlic,
    oregano, jasmine, and mint. I also enjoy cooking and baking, with a focus on middle 
    eastern dishes and desserts. I am a huge sweet tooth as well, and will never say no
    to going out to get a sweet treet with my friends and family! I love sudoku, reading,
    and browsing Fragrantica in idle times.
